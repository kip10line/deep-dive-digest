# 🌊 Deep-Dive Digest

**Deep-Dive Digest** is a next-generation, AI-powered research assistant that transforms a single topic into a comprehensive, multi-dimensional report. Unlike standard search engines, it utilizes a **6-Layer Research-First Architecture** to synthesize insights from across the entire digital spectrum—including the open web, academic archives, open-source repositories, and even the dark web.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 6-Layer Research Engine
The application simultaneously fetches and synchronizes data from six high-authority channels:
*   **🎥 YouTube**: Curated educational videos and expert visual breakdowns.
*   **🌐 Web Search**: Broad context from the global open web.
*   **📰 Global News**: Real-time updates and current events from international outlets.
*   **🧪 Scientific Papers**: Peer-reviewed academic research directly from **ArXiv.org**.
*   **💻 GitHub**: Real-world implementation tools and trending open-source projects.
*   **🧅 Tor Network**: Alternative perspectives and non-indexed insights from the **Dark Web** (via secure clearnet aggregators).

### 🎨 AI-Generated Illustrations
Every section of your digest is uniquely visualized by AI. Using **Pollinations AI**, the system generates illustrative, context-aware images that make technical research more engaging and easier to digest.

### 📄 PDF Export
One-click export allows you to save your entire research session as a high-quality, dark-themed PDF, perfect for offline reading or sharing.

### 🛡️ Hallucination-Free Analysis
Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, our LLM layer is strictly constrained to synthesize information *only* from the verified research results fetched in Layer 1.
